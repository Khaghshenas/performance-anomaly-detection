# Reinforcement Learning–Based Performance Anomaly Detection

This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to detect, predict, and mitigate performance degradation in physical servers.

The system:
- Learns from real-time performance metrics (CPU, memory, latency).
- Detects anomalies proactively.
- Optimizes server power states dynamically to balance **efficiency** and **reliability**.
- Uses PyTorch to train an RL agent that interacts with a custom server environment.
